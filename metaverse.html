        <h1>The Metaverse is Just the Internet</h1>

        <p>
        It's been said before, I'll say it again: The "Metaverse" is another word
        for "Internet."
        </p>

        <p>
        My guess is that you agree with me, but in case you don't I'll argue a bit.
        First, let's look at our diverse set of Metaverse definitions:
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Snow Crash:</b> The term 'metaverse' was coined by Neal Stephenson in the 1992 book
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash">Snow Crash</a>. (Fun read. If you
            haven't read it yet, grab it from your online library.) The 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldWideWeb">first web browser</a> was released
            to the public only the year before.
        </p>

        Here's how Stephenson introduces the Metaverse:
        <blockquote>
            <i>So Hiro's not actually here at all. He's in a computer-generated universe that his
            computer is drawing onto his goggles and pumping into his earphones. In the lingo,
            this imaginary place is called the Metaverse. Hiro spends a lot of time in the
            Metaverse. It beats the shit out of the U-Stor-It.</i>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        Proper noun Metaverse. Not 'just the internet'. But close enough. Think Tik Tok, Instagram,
        social media. It's a retreat from the
        real world, better than facing life in a storage unit.
        </p>

        <p>
        Snow Crash centers on a
        digitized mind-control drug, to be distributed to all users of the Metaverse (and granting
        control to one L. Bob Rife). Snow Crash
        is a warning, and it's a warning that applies equally to hours spent
        "inside" the two-dimensional Tik Tok as hours inside Meta's 3D worlds.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Andrew Ball:</b> Andrew Ball is a VC who literally wrote the
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1324092033">book</a> on the metaverse.
            Shortly before all the covid-metaverse-hype, he published an in-depth
            <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse">blog</a> defining the
            metaverse.
        </p>

        <p>Before his definition, his caveat:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <i>Just as it was hard to envision in 1982 what the Internet of 2020
                would be - and harder still to communicate it to those who had never
                even "logged" onto it at that time - we don't really know how to
                describe the Metaverse.</i>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I read that as: "The metaverse is whatever we end up with." (And if we still
        end up with the internet, well then the metaverse is the internet.)</p>

        <p>Anyway, he provides 7 primary characteristics of the metaverse:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Be persistent</li>
            <li>Be synchronous and live</li>
            <li>Be without any cap to concurrent users, while also providing each user with an individual sense of "presence"</li>
            <li>Be a fully functioning economy</li>
            <li>Be an experience that spans both the digital and physical worlds</li>
            <li>Offer unprecedented interoperability</li>
            <li>Be populated by "content" and "experiences" created and operated by an incredibly wide range of contributors</li>
        </ol>

        <p>So now go back and read it again to convince yourself that this defines the
        metaverse, in addition to the internet. :)</p>

        <p>None of the characteristics are even new features of the internet. We
        had MUD in 1980, the first online Visa payment was processed in 1994 - purchasing
        a physical CD. It's the most diverse platform ever invented.</p>

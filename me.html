        <p>
        I am Morgan. I'm a hacker who loves ideas.
        I've spent time in silicon valley, now, like everyone
        else, I'm living in Austin. (:

        <h3>What I love</h3>

        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Hacking</b>: Used to play a lot of CTFs, now just hack on whatever comes up.
        It's important to me to not break laws when hacking, so my hacker friends
        tend to have experimented more than me.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Reading</b>: Sci-fi, some non-fiction. Reading's usually a guilty pleasure, a la YouTube.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>Food</b>: I cook fairly often, but if you make me a nice juicy steak,
        I'll love you forever. Love you Dad.
